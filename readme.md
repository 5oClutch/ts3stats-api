### TsStats
Tsstats allows you to record your Teamspeak statistics, and provide you with a graph of the amount and average users on your teamspeak.

TsStats is using the PlanetTeamspeak web API to collect Teamspeak server users and store them in a database. Users can use the TsStats API to get all the data in a JSON format and use it on your website.
